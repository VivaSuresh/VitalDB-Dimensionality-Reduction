### VitalDB-Dimensionality-Reduction ###

This project contains methods and techniques for testing important covariates in the VitalDB dataset. The main focus is to use dimensionality reduction techniques to identify significant covariates that contribute to outcomes in the dataset.

**Using the Virtual Environment**

To start using the project, follow these steps to activate the pre-configured virtual environment on the Linux server.

1) Activate the Virtual Environment

From the project directory, run the following command to activate the virtual environment:

`source .venv/bin/activate`

You should see the prompt change to indicate that the `.venv` environment is active.

2) Start Coding
Once the environment is active, you can start working on the project. You can run Python scripts or access the interactive Python shell using:

To run a Python script:
`python your_script.py`

To open an interactive Python shell:
`python`

Deactivate the Environment
When you're done working, you can deactivate the virtual environment by running:
`deactivate`

**Project Description**

The project uses various Python libraries, including:

- numpy for numerical operations
- pandas for data manipulation
- scikit-learn for machine learning and dimensionality reduction
- matplotlib for data visualization
- torch for advanced computations

Ensure that the virtual environment is activated before running any scripts to have access to these dependencies.
